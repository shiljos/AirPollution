# ZP-AirPollution


1. NOTE: XCode13 (iOS15 SDK) used for the project

2. Unit tests are added mostly for the Presenter (MVP), for good measure, even though they do not present high value due to the non-complexity of the project in general

3. 3 methods for error handling are put empty intentionally, as a result of an eventual request failure , since it wasn't specified and (maybe even not needed for this challenge) the names indicate what should be the eventual course of action
